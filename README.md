# Create a simple REST API with Express that supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a list items

# üìö Problem 19: Simple CRUD API with Express.js

Welcome to the **19th Node.js problem**! In this challenge, you'll create a simple **CRUD API** for managing a list of books using **Express.js**. This problem will help you understand and implement the essential HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

---

## üìù Problem Description

Build a RESTful API that performs **CRUD operations** on a collection of books. Each book will have the following attributes:

- `id`: A unique identifier (integer).
- `title`: The title of the book (string).
- `author`: The author of the book (string).

The API should expose the following endpoints:

1. **GET /books**: Retrieve a list of all books.
2. **POST /books**: Add a new book to the list.
3. **PUT /books/:id**: Update the details of an existing book by its `id`.
4. **DELETE /books/:id**: Remove a book from the list by its `id`.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement **CRUD operations** using Express.js.
- Learn how to work with **route parameters** and **request body**.
- Implement basic error handling for invalid or non-existent resources.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project folder should have the following structure:

```bash
19-rest-api-crud-operation-node-problem/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js         # Main server file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # Documentation for this problem
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json      # Project configuration file
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
        git clone <https://github.com/your-username/problem-19-crud-api.git>
        cd problem-19-crud-api
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
        npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Server**

    ```bash
        node server.js
    ```

    The server will start at <http://localhost:8080>.
